## Description
Revenue generation is the most important focus of most businesses. Without it, a company cannot earn profit and stay viable in the long run. Low revenue leads to an unprofitable business and negative financial results. Retail Store XYZ has been in operation since 2008. It's until 2016 that the store's revenue has been decreasing by 10%. Having a large dataset that is not in use, this research seeks to populate a Customer Segmentation Model that can help the firm market and sell more effectively.
